# Utah Coding BootCamp

## second module, second challenge

**Welcome.**  This is the repository for Challenge #2, an imaginary portfolio 
for code I have not actually written. I tried to make it simple as
possible- three scrolling sections attached to a minimal link bar at the 
top. I used a fledgling knowledge of js to write a tiny little script for the
captions to the picture links to my application ideas. At the bottom is a
contact me section. Overall, I was going for a feeling of clean lines and
white space.
